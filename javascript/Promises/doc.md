// To cancel my application in prepbytes and refund.

Hello sir!
I am Satheesh M .Hope you are doing well. I am here for seeking your help. Last month(28th october) I have enrolled for the full stack elevator academy course. My mentor Chandni sharma (77019 69274) from prepbytes told me the details that the classes are starts from 2nd November. But that's not happened. And also after 10 days the access for the portal is not given for me. So I asked him please cancel my application and refund my down payment of Rs.2500. But she did not respond and gives another person's number Praveen(92897 15112) and he is also not responded as well as chandni sharma. Then I see the details about how to cancel application in prepbytes website. Then I mailed to support team .They told me that my application and loan will be cancelled within 30 working days .But now one person(Laboni -6294 392 979) from perpbytes mailed me that your money will not be refunded and you should need to pay all the EMI's.
              So without nothing I she told me that I should need to pay RS.30000. Please tell me sir how it is fair. I am also not a good position in my life and I don't have job also. I already told about my self to my mentor also .Then she is not responding. 
           Please sir help me through this. This is really unfair without anything just for applied one course in prepbytes I should need to pay RS.30000.
