    <h3>Positions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        static==>The default value, the element follows the flow of the content
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        fixed==>The element is positioned relative to the viewport and removed
        from the normal flow of the document. The top, right ,left and bottom
        properties can be used to move the element
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        relative==> The element is positioned in the same place as it would be
        eith static . however it can be responded with top,left,right and bottom
        relative to its natural position
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        sticky==> The element will be similar to relative positioned element
        ,but once it scrolls off it will stay to fixed to screen, essentially
        acting as position : fixed. This is particularly useful for menu bars
        that need to "stick" to the top if the screen as the user scrolls
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        absolute==>BY default this will act as fixed except element will be
        relative to the document instead of viewport. This means that as the
        page is scrolled it will move with the page rather than stay at the same
        viewport location. However if any element above it in the DOM,
        oftentimes referred to as an ancestor, has a position value each other
        than static ,then it will be positioned to that nearest positioned
        ancestor.
      </li>

      <h4>EXAMPLE</h4>

      <p id="single--line">I am a paragraph!</p>
      <section>
        <div id="box">BOX </div>
        <p id="long">
          I am a paragraph! I am a paragraph! I am a paragraph! I am a
          paragraph! I am a paragraph! I am a paragraph! I am a paragraph! I am
          a paragraph! I am a paragraph! I am a paragraph!
        </p>
        <h4>z-index ==>to show or overshadow required elements over other elements ==>create stacking cotexts  </h4>
        <h4>float</h4>
        <p>float around other elements, removes the content from the flow ==>float:left (or) right  ==> float the element at one side of the container</p>
        <p>Used in blog posts</p>
        <p>clear==> Make the element go belong to the element which has float property</p>
        <p>clear:both(right and left)</p>
